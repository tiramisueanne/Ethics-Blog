A lot of the things that are valued within the startup world are stereotypically masculine, such as giving up social life in lieu of work, or being hyper-sexual in terms of how to party or relax. Women are often seen as less likely to sacrifice themselves and their health for the company. As a result, many startups don’t have women until they need women to improve their reputation, to be seen as diverse and welcoming. Without women involved in the establishment of a company’s culture, it is possible for companies to develop a culture that is unsympathetic to anyone who doesn’t conform.

By the time the company becomes large enough to afford a human resources department, this culture has already set within the workplace and if the company is running “well”, no one will seek to change it. There are loss aversion tactics that are undoubtedly employed: if you are sexually harassing someone, then to avoid losing reputation or having to admit that you did something wrong to yourself, you punish the woman for accusing. The virtue framework of ethics also plays a role: a person who harasses women is not seen as ethical, so even if it happens, investigations get shut down to continue to exalt the perpetrator. Additionally, if a manager is otherwise a good person besides a chauvinistic, racist, ableist, etc. bias, his otherwise virtuous behavior exalts him, and makes it more acceptable for others to engage in these illegal behaviors.
    
When these reports came out, the negative PR was so strong that enough people made the switch to cause Uber some worry. They employed a black woman CEO soon after  “Reflecting on One Very Strange Year at Uber” came out to try to negate some of these effects. As seen by this example with Uber, when reports of these events reach the mainstream, change can happen. The negative PR snapped Uber out of their apathy, and the duty-based framework can be seen in Uber’s actions to go with a morally good option to not only gain back people’s trust, but attempt to stop the culture that endured.

  Group projects often lead to less than ideal power dynamics and awkward work situations. Bob does not respect Alice’s contribution to the project in his move to rewrite her work rather than meet with her to understand it. Alice could have felt this move implies that Bob does not think her competent, and that he didn’t recognize her effort. Carlos only defended Alice’s code after she brought him into the conflict, so she might feel that he didn’t stick up for her while he might feel needlessly involved. In terms of gender, Bob’s move might have been informed by a bias against women in tech which Alice probably picked up on. If Carlos were Carlita (our group’s personification of a female Carlos), we think Carlita would have recognized this as well and have been more enthusiastic to speak up.
  
  
  Conflicts can often times change work dynamics and personal relationships to the detriment of the group. The disagreement could lead to a decrease in productivity and quality if the group does not resolve their conflict because their communication would greatly decrease from personal biases. The group could be hesitant to express their issues, and this would most likely lead to more arguments. If the members had to work together again in the future, they may maintain the same prejudices and their next project would be affected as well. 
  
  The best way for all three of the group members to alleviate this situation is to have better communication and higher awareness of each other’s feelings. Bob should apologize and understand the offense he had caused to Alice, acknowledging that his actions were disrespectful. Carlos should act as a mediator, helping both Alice and Bob fully understand each other and why they feel the way they do. Alice should accept Bob’s apology and try not to hold prejudice during the remainder of the project. The group should decide what goes on the master branch together. They should respect each other’s contributions to the master version, and even perhaps merge code if that works out better.
