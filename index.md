YouTube has the responsibility to allow users to upload their own content and voice their thoughts through comments. However, it also has the responsibility to monitor and restrict hostile or easily falsifiable content. Content that is illegal, such as pedophilic pornography, shouldn’t be hosted and comments that promote illegal activity should be deleted as well. Youtube’s responsibility to advertisers is to put advertisements on advertiser-friendly content and match advertisements to that content.

The content on Youtube is intuitively both the responsibility of the creator and Youtube. Advertisers, who indirectly support the hosting of the videos through paying Youtube, control Youtube’s funding and therefore control the content. Because of this framing, Youtube now becomes the sole entity responsible for unacceptable content being displayed, which initially feels incorrect due to their only accidental involvement in someone hosting harmful content.  From an intent-perspective, this is wholly unfair, as Youtube isn’t trying to promote inappropriate videos, but from a consequentialist framework, causes more damage than an individual criminal ever could. 

YouTube’s business model is sometimes ethical, however, hosting hostile and illegal content and making it monetizable through ads is in no way ethical. YouTube has the responsibility to filter out harmful content and comments and only put ads on advertiser-friendly content. Therefore, if a user is publishing false information, the user should not be able to make money from advertisements on Youtube because “fake news” can create harm in the form of misinformation, which can damage the lives of people trying to find solutions to “fake news” when there isn’t one. Youtube should also not be able to profit off of harmful content. Technology plays a neutral role in this situation because it is both harmful and helpful. Although it can spread harmful and false content, which can hurt innocent people, it can also expose actual harm to the world and bring justice to those who were wronged.

Although Amazon is a highly profitable company, 10% of their workers in Ohio are on food stamps, indicating that Amazon does not pay their employees enough and are taking advantage of local government support. Amazon continues to encroach on the privacy of their employees in the name of efficiency with disregard to their dignity or humanity. This is evidence of a lack of duty-based ethical thinking as Amazon is not thinking about its obligations to their employees. Amazon is not respecting their employees’ autonomy and privacy, as exhibited by the Amazon wristband that can track employees’ locations and direct them in completing tasks. 

Considering that Amazon already has significant business subsidies and tax breaks, Amazon has the responsibility to give back to the local community and boost its economy. Amazon’s employees should not be on food stamps or required to work dizzying schedules since Amazon are given assistance from the government. The American government provides assistance to companies for bringing jobs to communities and stimulating the local economy. As a result, many corporations are able to take advantage of the monetary buffer the government provides them. Some companies, such as Amazon, decide to use this buffer to increase profit rather than life quality of their employees, which the public is more than happy to support. People continue to buy from Amazon despite their bad reputation because of the convenience and low cost, meaning that people will gladly save two dollars instead of supporting healthy workers. However, it should be noted that most people are not aware that the low cost of product is often due overworked employees who are not getting paid enough.

Technology provides possible small efficiency benefits but over-supervising employees can do more harm than good, leading to, in a consequentialist framework, an overall negative ethical role. As said by a former employee, “The robotic technology isn’t up to scratch yet, so until it is, they will use human robots.” In this regard, technology is fully responsible for the strain of Amazon workers.

Through the Challenger disaster we see people who understood the technology and dangers of certain aspects of the rocket, who tried their best to stop the launch and warn the people in authority who decided to continue with the launch anyways. Because of only telecommunications being used, maybe the urgency in the engineers’ messages could not be conveyed in totality (Kaplan). However, after the disaster, the fraud was exposed due to TV coverage, which shamed NASA nationally. If those in authority had some sort of technological understanding, maybe they would’ve listened to the engineers and obliged to their outcries, possibly even to negate the negative press. 

Oftentimes, people are afraid to speak out against authority in fear of the consequences that could follow, such as losing their job or facing public humiliation. President Reagan was scheduled to discuss NASA in his State of the Union address and NASA prided themselves on “sending up shuttles routinely and reliably” (Kaplan). The Challenger launch had already been delayed once so NASA might have felt pressured to stay on schedule. Although Ebeling, McDonald, Thompson, and Boisjoly didn’t hesitate to warn NASA executives and officials because they knew the launch was in danger, the executives and officials ignored their dire warning and approved the launch anyway. After the launch failed, the engineers revealed to the press that they had warned NASA that the launch would fail, and a result, the engineers were blackballed, blacklisted, and labelled as “whistleblowers”. 

The first framework that comes to mind is virtue-based: the engineers might have over-trusted the managers to make an informed and ethical decision due to the fact that no American had been killed after leaving the launchpad (Zak). Another reason why the engineers could have over-trusted them is the bias that managers are in a position of authority due to more merit or intelligence, and therefore should be trusted. The managers could have been operating from a Consequentialist perspective, where the perceived small risk was worth getting a successful launch talked about in the Union Address (Kaplan).

A lot of the things that are valued within the startup world are stereotypically masculine, such as giving up social life in lieu of work, or being hyper-sexual in terms of how to party or relax. Women are often seen as less likely to sacrifice themselves and their health for the company. As a result, many startups don’t have women until they need women to improve their reputation, to be seen as diverse and welcoming. Without women involved in the establishment of a company’s culture, it is possible for companies to develop a culture that is unsympathetic to anyone who doesn’t conform.

By the time the company becomes large enough to afford a human resources department, this culture has already set within the workplace and if the company is running “well”, no one will seek to change it. There are loss aversion tactics that are undoubtedly employed: if you are sexually harassing someone, then to avoid losing reputation or having to admit that you did something wrong to yourself, you punish the woman for accusing. The virtue framework of ethics also plays a role: a person who harasses women is not seen as ethical, so even if it happens, investigations get shut down to continue to exalt the perpetrator. Additionally, if a manager is otherwise a good person besides a chauvinistic, racist, ableist, etc. bias, his otherwise virtuous behavior exalts him, and makes it more acceptable for others to engage in these illegal behaviors.
    
When these reports came out, the negative PR was so strong that enough people made the switch to cause Uber some worry. They employed a black woman CEO soon after  “Reflecting on One Very Strange Year at Uber” came out to try to negate some of these effects. As seen by this example with Uber, when reports of these events reach the mainstream, change can happen. The negative PR snapped Uber out of their apathy, and the duty-based framework can be seen in Uber’s actions to go with a morally good option to not only gain back people’s trust, but attempt to stop the culture that endured.

  Group projects often lead to less than ideal power dynamics and awkward work situations. Bob does not respect Alice’s contribution to the project in his move to rewrite her work rather than meet with her to understand it. Alice could have felt this move implies that Bob does not think her competent, and that he didn’t recognize her effort. Carlos only defended Alice’s code after she brought him into the conflict, so she might feel that he didn’t stick up for her while he might feel needlessly involved. In terms of gender, Bob’s move might have been informed by a bias against women in tech which Alice probably picked up on. If Carlos were Carlita (our group’s personification of a female Carlos), we think Carlita would have recognized this as well and have been more enthusiastic to speak up.
  
  
  Conflicts can often times change work dynamics and personal relationships to the detriment of the group. The disagreement could lead to a decrease in productivity and quality if the group does not resolve their conflict because their communication would greatly decrease from personal biases. The group could be hesitant to express their issues, and this would most likely lead to more arguments. If the members had to work together again in the future, they may maintain the same prejudices and their next project would be affected as well. 
  
  The best way for all three of the group members to alleviate this situation is to have better communication and higher awareness of each other’s feelings. Bob should apologize and understand the offense he had caused to Alice, acknowledging that his actions were disrespectful. Carlos should act as a mediator, helping both Alice and Bob fully understand each other and why they feel the way they do. Alice should accept Bob’s apology and try not to hold prejudice during the remainder of the project. The group should decide what goes on the master branch together. They should respect each other’s contributions to the master version, and even perhaps merge code if that works out better.
