Gamification is a marketing technique implemented through gaming elements and competition. Gamification is applying game-design elements to real-world activities. Specifically, gamification focuses mainly on human motivation. It’s a smart technique that leverages humans by giving them a sense of achievement and competition. 

Gamification can be helpful in creating and maintaining healthy habits. Duolingo uses development/accomplishment and loss/avoidance of the core drives of gamification to retain users. Duolingo uses development/accomplishment by rewarding users with a badge for completing a lesson and also by allowing users to see their progress. Duolingo forces users to use Duolingo as a habit by employing loss/avoidance framework in which users will lose their streak if they do not use Duolingo and meet their goal of practicing x minutes a day. Gamification can be used to encourage users to maintain healthy habits and maximize productivity.

Gamification can be negative in that it can make something that the user doesn’t intrinsically enjoy or value addictive. Social media specifically targets the social influence core in which it can invite envy from users. In addition, social media maintains its user base through acting as a means for escapism as users will log back on their social media to avoid their responsibilities and spend their time engaging with other users. By increasing engagement with other users and content, social media can trap users into a toxic cycle in which users are unable to work productively.

Play incentives encourage users to come back and engage with the activity whereas addiction is when users become uncomfortable without this certain activity. Although it may be hard to distinguish the two, play incentives can act as a positive influence in a user’s life by encouraging learning while addiction serves as a negative effect by encouraging users to shirk their responsibilities. 

Companies can be encouraged to avoid addictive/exploitive mechanics by enhancing the user experience instead of relying on “engagement” to the product. For instance, if Instagram was a paid-for service, it would be easy to configure it such that no one could see each other’s like numbers, or followers. Companies could also be penalized if a significant portion of their user base exhibited addictive behaviors towards the game (30+ hours a week, for instance).

Piracy, and the technology that facilitated it, has changed the relationship between creators and consumers of content profoundly. Pirates hurt the development of paid-for content creation by removing compensation, and rationalize their choices through a variety of means, leading to financial issues for developers and long-term issues for consumers. Technology has been a major catalyst for piracy, and the loss experienced in paid-for content has caused tech to adapt to the new landscape.

Pirating reduces the developer’s ability to create more content, and diminishes the motivation for an aspiring developer to make content. People rationalize piracy through assuming the state of the developer, and treating the content as a public good that someone else will support. Pirating, and the unlimited fountain of material it opens up, can also cheapen the experience of consuming and anticipating the consumption of the material (Newshour). If pirating continues, companies will lose more money and cease to create content. For example, Expendables 3 lost about $100 million dollars due to piracy. Such losses can lead to the decrease of pension, benefits, and welfare of hundreds workers behind the scenes (Forbes).

Technology has made it easier to pirate products, such as software, movies, games, and books. Although DRM has made an attempt to make this more difficult, most implementations can be cracked. Due to this lack of obstacles, technological products, such as games, are free but depend on advertisements and in-product purchases. For instance, more and more games are becoming free because if developers don’t make it free, people will pirate the game and the company will lose money. Instead, they depend on in-game purchases and advertisements for revenue. Streaming services also pay artists minimal amounts per stream to make more money, therefore reducing the artist’s ability to support themselves.

Piracy affects the ability for developers to create content that costs money up front, causing us to have an entirely different landscape of media to consume. Technology has therefore created and destroyed entire forms of media through the creation of new platforms and the proliferation of piracy.

YouTube has the responsibility to allow users to upload their own content and voice their thoughts through comments. However, it also has the responsibility to monitor and restrict hostile or easily falsifiable content. Content that is illegal, such as pedophilic pornography, shouldn’t be hosted and comments that promote illegal activity should be deleted as well. Youtube’s responsibility to advertisers is to put advertisements on advertiser-friendly content and match advertisements to that content.

The content on Youtube is intuitively both the responsibility of the creator and Youtube. Advertisers, who indirectly support the hosting of the videos through paying Youtube, control Youtube’s funding and therefore control the content. Because of this framing, Youtube now becomes the sole entity responsible for unacceptable content being displayed, which initially feels incorrect due to their only accidental involvement in someone hosting harmful content.  From an intent-perspective, this is wholly unfair, as Youtube isn’t trying to promote inappropriate videos, but from a consequentialist framework, causes more damage than an individual criminal ever could. 

YouTube’s business model is sometimes ethical, however, hosting hostile and illegal content and making it monetizable through ads is in no way ethical. YouTube has the responsibility to filter out harmful content and comments and only put ads on advertiser-friendly content. Therefore, if a user is publishing false information, the user should not be able to make money from advertisements on Youtube because “fake news” can create harm in the form of misinformation, which can damage the lives of people trying to find solutions to “fake news” when there isn’t one. Youtube should also not be able to profit off of harmful content. Technology plays a neutral role in this situation because it is both harmful and helpful. Although it can spread harmful and false content, which can hurt innocent people, it can also expose actual harm to the world and bring justice to those who were wronged.

Although Amazon is a highly profitable company, 10% of their workers in Ohio are on food stamps, indicating that Amazon does not pay their employees enough and are taking advantage of local government support. Amazon continues to encroach on the privacy of their employees in the name of efficiency with disregard to their dignity or humanity. This is evidence of a lack of duty-based ethical thinking as Amazon is not thinking about its obligations to their employees. Amazon is not respecting their employees’ autonomy and privacy, as exhibited by the Amazon wristband that can track employees’ locations and direct them in completing tasks. 

Considering that Amazon already has significant business subsidies and tax breaks, Amazon has the responsibility to give back to the local community and boost its economy. Amazon’s employees should not be on food stamps or required to work dizzying schedules since Amazon are given assistance from the government. The American government provides assistance to companies for bringing jobs to communities and stimulating the local economy. As a result, many corporations are able to take advantage of the monetary buffer the government provides them. Some companies, such as Amazon, decide to use this buffer to increase profit rather than life quality of their employees, which the public is more than happy to support. People continue to buy from Amazon despite their bad reputation because of the convenience and low cost, meaning that people will gladly save two dollars instead of supporting healthy workers. However, it should be noted that most people are not aware that the low cost of product is often due overworked employees who are not getting paid enough.

Technology provides possible small efficiency benefits but over-supervising employees can do more harm than good, leading to, in a consequentialist framework, an overall negative ethical role. As said by a former employee, “The robotic technology isn’t up to scratch yet, so until it is, they will use human robots.” In this regard, technology is fully responsible for the strain of Amazon workers.

Through the Challenger disaster we see people who understood the technology and dangers of certain aspects of the rocket, who tried their best to stop the launch and warn the people in authority who decided to continue with the launch anyways. Because of only telecommunications being used, maybe the urgency in the engineers’ messages could not be conveyed in totality (Kaplan). However, after the disaster, the fraud was exposed due to TV coverage, which shamed NASA nationally. If those in authority had some sort of technological understanding, maybe they would’ve listened to the engineers and obliged to their outcries, possibly even to negate the negative press. 

Oftentimes, people are afraid to speak out against authority in fear of the consequences that could follow, such as losing their job or facing public humiliation. President Reagan was scheduled to discuss NASA in his State of the Union address and NASA prided themselves on “sending up shuttles routinely and reliably” (Kaplan). The Challenger launch had already been delayed once so NASA might have felt pressured to stay on schedule. Although Ebeling, McDonald, Thompson, and Boisjoly didn’t hesitate to warn NASA executives and officials because they knew the launch was in danger, the executives and officials ignored their dire warning and approved the launch anyway. After the launch failed, the engineers revealed to the press that they had warned NASA that the launch would fail, and a result, the engineers were blackballed, blacklisted, and labelled as “whistleblowers”. 

The first framework that comes to mind is virtue-based: the engineers might have over-trusted the managers to make an informed and ethical decision due to the fact that no American had been killed after leaving the launchpad (Zak). Another reason why the engineers could have over-trusted them is the bias that managers are in a position of authority due to more merit or intelligence, and therefore should be trusted. The managers could have been operating from a Consequentialist perspective, where the perceived small risk was worth getting a successful launch talked about in the Union Address (Kaplan).

A lot of the things that are valued within the startup world are stereotypically masculine, such as giving up social life in lieu of work, or being hyper-sexual in terms of how to party or relax. Women are often seen as less likely to sacrifice themselves and their health for the company. As a result, many startups don’t have women until they need women to improve their reputation, to be seen as diverse and welcoming. Without women involved in the establishment of a company’s culture, it is possible for companies to develop a culture that is unsympathetic to anyone who doesn’t conform.

By the time the company becomes large enough to afford a human resources department, this culture has already set within the workplace and if the company is running “well”, no one will seek to change it. There are loss aversion tactics that are undoubtedly employed: if you are sexually harassing someone, then to avoid losing reputation or having to admit that you did something wrong to yourself, you punish the woman for accusing. The virtue framework of ethics also plays a role: a person who harasses women is not seen as ethical, so even if it happens, investigations get shut down to continue to exalt the perpetrator. Additionally, if a manager is otherwise a good person besides a chauvinistic, racist, ableist, etc. bias, his otherwise virtuous behavior exalts him, and makes it more acceptable for others to engage in these illegal behaviors.
    
When these reports came out, the negative PR was so strong that enough people made the switch to cause Uber some worry. They employed a black woman CEO soon after  “Reflecting on One Very Strange Year at Uber” came out to try to negate some of these effects. As seen by this example with Uber, when reports of these events reach the mainstream, change can happen. The negative PR snapped Uber out of their apathy, and the duty-based framework can be seen in Uber’s actions to go with a morally good option to not only gain back people’s trust, but attempt to stop the culture that endured.

  Group projects often lead to less than ideal power dynamics and awkward work situations. Bob does not respect Alice’s contribution to the project in his move to rewrite her work rather than meet with her to understand it. Alice could have felt this move implies that Bob does not think her competent, and that he didn’t recognize her effort. Carlos only defended Alice’s code after she brought him into the conflict, so she might feel that he didn’t stick up for her while he might feel needlessly involved. In terms of gender, Bob’s move might have been informed by a bias against women in tech which Alice probably picked up on. If Carlos were Carlita (our group’s personification of a female Carlos), we think Carlita would have recognized this as well and have been more enthusiastic to speak up.
  
  
  Conflicts can often times change work dynamics and personal relationships to the detriment of the group. The disagreement could lead to a decrease in productivity and quality if the group does not resolve their conflict because their communication would greatly decrease from personal biases. The group could be hesitant to express their issues, and this would most likely lead to more arguments. If the members had to work together again in the future, they may maintain the same prejudices and their next project would be affected as well. 
  
  The best way for all three of the group members to alleviate this situation is to have better communication and higher awareness of each other’s feelings. Bob should apologize and understand the offense he had caused to Alice, acknowledging that his actions were disrespectful. Carlos should act as a mediator, helping both Alice and Bob fully understand each other and why they feel the way they do. Alice should accept Bob’s apology and try not to hold prejudice during the remainder of the project. The group should decide what goes on the master branch together. They should respect each other’s contributions to the master version, and even perhaps merge code if that works out better.
